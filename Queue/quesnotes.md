Queue is a basic data structure which is used to store elements;
A queue follows a principle of first in first out (FIFO)
The elements are added from the rear and deleted from the front

A queue can be implemented in python using three ways:
1.Using a list:-
Inserting and deleting will require O(n) time as elements needs to be pushed each time by one
2.Using Collections.deque:-
A better approach as it takes O(1) time to insert and delete (A better approach tha using list)
2.Usin the queue module:-
Python provides a module queue which helps implement queue as well as Stack(LIFOqueue), it provides various methods to help make life a littel easy :) ;
