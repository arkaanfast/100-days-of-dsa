# DSA-Python
Since data structres and algortihms is really important for all the programmers out there, I also am learning the basics of it.
I will be uploading the codes related to the DSA problems and it would be really helpfull if you take a look at it and help me out(by making it more efficient or if there was a better way to solve it).
If anyone having any queries feel free to ask I would be glad to help.
